## In case you missed it

The app has an offline mode!

If you attempt to refresh (by pulling down) or load more content (by scrolling to the bottom) without an internet connection, you'll be prompted to switch to offline mode.

Everything else in the app should be clear :)

### Note: 
I used only one third-party library, (CachedAsyncImage), for image caching. I noticed last minute that it can occasionally cause frame drops, so with more time Iâ€™d replace it with a native caching solution.
